# structure

# ModelBackend
# - takes as input the json file
# - generate the required coordinate system
# - has abstract functions that generate models of source, lens, convergence, etc...
# - has conrete functions that display pixelated models that are self-contained in the json

# - child classes: 
    # - LenstronomyBackend(ModelBackend)
    # - GleeBackend(ModelBackend)

# Plotter
# - defines general settings for all plots (colors, cmaps, etc...)
# - child classes
    # - Obervationlotter(Plotter)
    # - LightPlotter(Plotter)
        # - LensLightPlotter(LightPlotter)
        # - SourcePlotter(LightPlotter)
    # - MassPlotter(Plotter)

    
# Analyzer: similar to Plotter in the structure, but designed to measure metrics, physical quantities, etc. from a given model.
